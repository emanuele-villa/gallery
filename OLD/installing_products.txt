If you need to install a bundle of products, you can use the pullProducts
script to do so. An example of how to do that for larsoftobj version 1.19.01
is shown below. Please use the product name and version appropriate for your
experiment.

    -- get the pullProducts script, and make it executable
$ wget http://scisoft.fnal.gov/scisoft/bundles/tools/pullProducts
$ chmod +x pullProducts

    -- use pullProducts to install larsoftobj (and all of its dependencies)
    -- under $HOME/products
    -- Note that <platform> should be one of u14, u16, d14, d15, d16, slf6,
       slf7
An example use (appropriate for an SL7 machine, or a CentOS 7
machine) would be:

$ ./pullProducts $HOME/products slf7 larsoftobj-1.19.01 e14 prof
